# personal_website

My name is Eric Grimes and this is
my personal website project.
This will be used as a start for a fulling functional portfolio
that I will be able to use in future job searches.

This site will continuously evolve and grow as I do.

current pages
index.html is the homepage
aboutme.html is the an about me page that gives info into my personal life
portfolio.html shows off work I created
contact.html is a contact form for job or general inquiries
success.html is a page that is only shown after the contact form has been submitted
style.css design
script.js handles more dynamic portions of the website that cannot be handled with html or css
