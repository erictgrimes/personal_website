        I have been fond of the outdoors since the moment I could form memories.
        Growing up we were constantly on the move visiting new places and
        national parks. I recently summited Half Dome in Yosemite National Park,
        which is a feat I never thought I would get the chance to achieve. I was
        never one to sit still or remain stagnant in life and in work, which is
        why I am constantly on the lookout for opportunity for growth.

        With a degree in digital filmmaking, I was able to dive deeper into my
        passion for photography and dial in my skills. <br />It has now become
        an invaluable asset that helps in future jobs and projects.

      <p>
        When I was in 8th grade I picked up my brother's guitar and fell in love
        with the creation of music for the first time. I later taught myself how
        to not only play guitar but also piano. I used to sneak off into the
        music building in high school to the practice rooms when they were open
        and that is where I taught myself to play the piano. Learning an
        instrument creates new neural connections which improve both memory and
        focus.
